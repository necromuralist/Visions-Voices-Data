# You will work with data from the [Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).

# Run the next code cell without changes to load the training and validation sets in `X_train`, `X_valid`, `y_train`, and `y_valid`.  The test set is loaded in `X_test`.

# In[ ]:

# Read the data
X_full = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', index_col='Id')
X_test_full = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv', index_col='Id')

# Remove rows with missing target, separate target from predictors
X_full.dropna(axis=0, subset=['SalePrice'], inplace=True)
y = X_full.SalePrice
X_full.drop(['SalePrice'], axis=1, inplace=True)

# Break off validation set from training data
X_train_full, X_valid_full, y_train, y_valid = train_test_split(X_full, y, 
                                                                train_size=0.8, test_size=0.2,

# The next code cell uses code from the tutorial to preprocess the data and train a model.  Run this code without changes.

from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Preprocessing for numerical data
numerical_transformer = SimpleImputer(strategy='constant')

# Preprocessing for categorical data
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))
])

# Bundle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_cols),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_cols)

# Define model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)

# Bundle preprocessing and modeling code in a pipeline

# The code yields a value around 17862 for the mean absolute error (MAE).  In the next step, you will amend the code to do better.
# 
# # Step 1: Improve the performance
# 
# ### Part A
# 
# Now, it's your turn!  In the code cell below, define your own preprocessing steps and random forest model.  Fill in values for the following variables:
# - `numerical_transformer`
# - `categorical_transformer`
# - `model`
# 
# To pass this part of the exercise, you need only define valid preprocessing steps and a random forest model.

# In[ ]:


# Preprocessing for numerical data
numerical_transformer = ____ # Your code here

# Preprocessing for categorical data
categorical_transformer = ____ # Your code here

# Bundle preprocessing for numerical and categorical data
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numerical_transformer, numerical_cols),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_cols)
    ])

# Define model
model = ____ # Your code here

# Check your answer
step_1.a.check()

# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_1.a.hint()
#step_1.a.solution()


# ### Part B
# 
# Run the code cell below without changes.
# 
# To pass this step, you need to have defined a pipeline in **Part A** that achieves lower MAE than the code above.  You're encouraged to take your time here and try out many different approaches, to see how low you can get the MAE!  (_If your code does not pass, please amend the preprocessing steps and model in Part A._)

# In[ ]:


# Bundle preprocessing and modeling code in a pipeline
my_pipeline = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                              ('model', model)
                             ])

# Preprocessing of training data, fit model 
my_pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Preprocessing of validation data, get predictions
preds = my_pipeline.predict(X_valid)

# Evaluate the model
score = mean_absolute_error(y_valid, preds)
print('MAE:', score)

# Check your answer
step_1.b.check()


# In[ ]:


# Line below will give you a hint
#step_1.b.hint()


# # Step 2: Generate test predictions
# 
# Now, you'll use your trained model to generate predictions with the test data.

# In[ ]:


# Preprocessing of test data, fit model
preds_test = ____ # Your code here

# Check your answer
step_2.check()


# In[ ]:


# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code
#step_2.hint()
#step_2.solution()


# Run the next code cell without changes to save your results to a CSV file that can be submitted directly to the competition.

# In[ ]:


# Save test predictions to file
output = pd.DataFrame({'Id': X_test.index,
                       'SalePrice': preds_test})
output.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)


# # Step 3: Submit your results
# 
# Once you have successfully completed Step 2, you're ready to submit your results to the leaderboard!  If you choose to do so, make sure that you have already joined the competition by clicking on the **Join Competition** button at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-data-for-ml-course).  
# - Begin by clicking on the blue **COMMIT** button in the top right corner.  This will generate a pop-up window.  
# - After your code has finished running, click on the blue **Open Version** button in the top right of the pop-up window.  This brings you into view mode of the same page. You will need to scroll down to get back to these instructions.
# - Click on the **Output** tab on the left of the screen.  Then, click on the **Submit to Competition** button to submit your results to the leaderboard.
# - If you want to keep working to improve your performance, select the blue **Edit** button in the top right of the screen. Then you can change your model and repeat the process.
# 
# # Keep going
# 
# Move on to learn about [**cross-validation**](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/cross-validation), a technique you can use to obtain more accurate estimates of model performance!

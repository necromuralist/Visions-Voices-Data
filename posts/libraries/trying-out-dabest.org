The famous Iris database, first used by Sir R.A. Fisher. The dataset is taken
from Fisher's paper. Note that it's the same as in R, but not as in the UCI
Machine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.

This is perhaps the best known database to be found in the
pattern recognition literature.  Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and
is referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The
data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a
type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the
latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

** Hedge's G
   [[https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/software/dataplot/refman2/auxillar/hedgeg.htm][Hedges G]] is a measurement of effect size, similar to Cohen's d but with better properties when the samples are smaller or the sample sizes are different.

DABEST v0.2.7
=============
             
Good afternoon!
The current time is Mon Dec 16 15:56:24 2019.

The unpaired Hedges' g between setosa and versicolor is 6.76 [95%CI 5.71, 7.86].
The two-sided p-value of the Mann-Whitney test is 2.28e-18.

The unpaired Hedges' g between setosa and virginica is 8.49 [95%CI 7.08, 9.77].
The two-sided p-value of the Mann-Whitney test is 2.43e-18.

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.

To get the results of all valid statistical tests, use `.hedges_g.statistical_tests`
#+end_example

According to [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Effect_size][Wikipedia]], an effect size of 2 is "huge" so since the differences between the setosa and versicolor and setosa and virginica are 6.76 and 8.49 respectively, we might conclude that there is a significant difference between the petal width of the setosa and the other two species.

I don't think that's really what this is meant for, but I just wanted to see how it works.

** Cohen's D

=============
             
Good afternoon!
The current time is Mon Dec 16 16:46:25 2019.

The unpaired Cohen's d between setosa and versicolor is 6.82 [95%CI 5.76, 7.92].
The two-sided p-value of the Mann-Whitney test is 2.28e-18.

The unpaired Cohen's d between setosa and virginica is 8.56 [95%CI 7.13, 9.85].
The two-sided p-value of the Mann-Whitney test is 2.43e-18.

5000 bootstrap samples were taken; the confidence interval is bias-corrected and accelerated.
The p-value(s) reported are the likelihood(s) of observing the effect size(s),
if the null hypothesis of zero difference is true.

To get the results of all valid statistical tests, use `.cohens_d.statistical_tests`
#+end_example

In this case the Cohen's d and Hedges g look similar.

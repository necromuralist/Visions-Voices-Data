* Beginning
  This is assignment 1 from the Nature of Code course on Kadenze. I was originally going to make it a mouse-follower but I re-read the instructions and it seems like it's better to make it a random-walker. These are the requirements:

** Create A Walker
   - Create an object that moves around the screen
   - Incorporate randomness or perlin noise
** Specifications
   - Needs to be visually different from the Nature of Code examples
   - Use comments
   - Only use =p5.js= libraries

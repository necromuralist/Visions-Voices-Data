I'm reading "The theory that would not die" and these are notes I took from them. The book didn't really give me a clear idea about what Price's argument was so I also read a [[https://qz.com/1315731/the-most-important-formula-in-data-science-was-first-used-to-prove-the-existence-of-god/][Quartz]] article about that part of the story and, of course, Wikipedia came into it at some points.
* A Brief Sketch of The Timelines to Bayes' Theorem
  - 1718: [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Abraham_de_Moivre][Abraham de Moivre]] publishes [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/The_Doctrine_of_Chances][The Doctrine of Chances]], the first textbook on probability.
  - 1746-1749: Somewhere in this period [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Thomas_Bayes][Thomas Bayes]] comes writes [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/An_Essay_towards_solving_a_Problem_in_the_Doctrine_of_Chances][An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of the Chances]] which describes elements of Inverse Probability, in which the probability of a cause is calculated based on observed effects, stated as a thought experiment in which a person turned away from a table estimates the position of a ball based on being told whether subsequent balls randomly dropped on the same table are to the left or the right of it.
  - 1748: [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/David_Hume][David Hume]] publishes [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Of_Miracles][Of Miracles]], in which he argues that since miracles are, by nature, singular, they can never have as much evidence in their favor as against them.
  - 1749: [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pierre-Simon_Laplace][Pierre-Simon Laplace]] is born
  - 1764: [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Richard_Price][Richard Price]] publishes [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/An_Essay_towards_solving_a_Problem_in_the_Doctrine_of_Chances][An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of the Chances]] with his additions, believing that it could act as a refutation of Hume's argument
  - 1774: Laplace comes up with idea that the probability of a cause given the observed effect is the ratio of the probability of that effect given the cause to sum of the probabilities for all other causes given that effect.
  - 1781: Price tells [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Marquis_de_Condorcet][the Marquis of Condorcet]] about Bayes' work and Laplace incorporates the use of the prior into his formulation
  - 1810: Laplace discovers [[https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Central_limit_theorem][the Central Limit Theorem]]
  - 1814: Laplace extends his version of Bayes' equation

* The Equations
  Since it's hard to write out the equations in bullet points I'm going to write some simple versions here.
** Bayes' Formulation
   "The theory that would not die" notes that Bayes' didn't write out an equation, but it can be written out something like this.
\[
P(\textit{cause}|\textit{effect}) = \frac{P(\textit{effect}|\textit{cause}) P(\textit{cause})}{P(\textit{effect})}
\]
** Laplace's First Version
   Originally Laplace didn't have the prior's in his equation (I'll substitute /C/ for /cause/, /E/ for /effect/ and /C'/ for not our theorized cause).
\[
P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C)}{\sum P(E|C')}
\]
** Laplace's Final Version
\[
P(C|E) = \frac{P(E|C)P_{\textit{prior}}(C)}{\sum P(E|C') P_{\textit{prior}} (C')}
\]

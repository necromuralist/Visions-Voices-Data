* Introduction
** Data Sources
   - [[http://snap.stanford.edu/data/][Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection]]
   - [[https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu][UCI Network Data Repository]]

* Requirements
  1. Create and upload a visualization
  2. Note if a subset of the data was used
  3. Note particular features of note in the visualization
  4. Describe what the data and visualization show
* Rubric
** Proximate Layout
   How well are related items placed near each other? Do the edges cross or do items overlap when perhaps they do not need to?
   Are the crossings distracting?
** Design of the Visulization
   Dose the visualization effectively use the assignment of variables to elements and design of a visualization?
** Contest
   How interesting is the result? Does this represent an interesting choice of data and/or an interesting way to display the data?

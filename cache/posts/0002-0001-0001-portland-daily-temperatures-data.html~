I'm going to work with the Daily Temperatures data set for Portland, Oregon (measured at the airport) taken from the <a href="https://w2.weather.gov/climate/local_data.php?wfo=pqr">National Weather Service</a>. I cleaned it up a little already, removing the extra header rows and adding a missing column header (<code>Metric</code>) but the data is arranged with the year and month as a column and then each day is given its own column, which isn't how I want to work with it, so I'm going to transform it a little to make it more like what I expect it to look like.}
